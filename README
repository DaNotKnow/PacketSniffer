3 - What does this program do?
**************************************************************************
This simple program just sniff your packets. You can also filter the packets
by source and destination MAC,IP and PORT.

I created this while i was ( still am) studying about C sockets. So i decided
to try to code my own program. 

BTW im not a good C programmer, hence, the structure of the program kinda 
sucks (im studying more of this now, maybe i can make a better one!)

***************************************************************************
4 - How to install
**************************************************************************
To compile the program, follow this steps:

a. Unpack and unzip the program.
b. cd to unzip folder
c. make
d. ./packetsniffer

***************************************************************************
5 - Security Issues
**************************************************************************
The are some buffer overflows and Heap overflows vulnerabilities. So i dont
recommend the use on a "real" pc.
